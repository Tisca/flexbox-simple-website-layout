        <header>Hello, my name is Tisca.</header>
        <main>
            <p>I am a <span>trained graphic designer</span> and aim to work as a <span>web designer</span>.
                That's why I take online courses and practice daily.
                Currently, I am learning how to code responsive websites.</p>

        <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
            <p>Being creative is part of who I am. As a kid, I loved to <span>draw, write
                tales and make up entire worlds</span>. The Neverending Story (the film when
            I was about five years old, the book when I was twelve) was formative
            for me. And, of course, all the cartoons and animations that have
            come out since the late '80s.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
            <p>I was fascinated by the characters and tried to imitate special effects
            with colored pencils and brushes.
            During my training, I came into contact with <span>graphic design software</span>
            for the first time. The world of vector graphics was love at first
            sight - and a relief, because until then, I had tried to draw perfect
            outlines by hand.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
            <p>Since then, I have gained experience designing for print, fashion,
            and screen. When creating corporate designs for companies, sometimes
            a simple website was part of the whole package. That was my introduction
            to the <span>magic of coding</span>. At one point, I worked closely with the
            development team and was even able to help design a minigame!</p>
